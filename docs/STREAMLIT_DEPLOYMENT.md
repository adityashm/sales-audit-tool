## Troubleshooting Deployment

### ‚ùå Build Failed

**Check build logs for errors:**
- Missing dependencies in requirements.txt
- Syntax errors in src/app.py
- Incompatible package versions

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Test locally first
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run src/app.py

# If works locally, push to GitHub
git push
```

### ‚ùå App Crashes on Startup

**Common causes:**
- Import errors
- Missing secrets
- Configuration issues

**Solution:**
1. Check logs in Streamlit Cloud
2. Verify secrets are configured
3. Test locally with same secrets

### ‚ùå Authentication Not Working

**Check:**
- Secrets configured correctly in Streamlit Cloud
- Format is correct TOML
- No extra spaces or quotes

**Correct format:**
```toml
[passwords]
admin = "password123"
```

**Incorrect:**
```toml
[passwords]
admin = password123        # Missing quotes
admin = "password123"      # Extra quotes around value
```

### ‚ùå File Upload 403 Error

**Solution:**
- Remove `enableCORS` and `enableXsrfProtection` from config.toml
- Let Streamlit Cloud use defaults
- See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for details

### ‚ùå App is Slow

**Reasons:**
- Large file uploads
- Complex calculations
- Free tier limitations

**Solutions:**
1. Optimize code (use caching)
2. Reduce file sizes
3. Upgrade to paid plan for more resources

## Security Best Practices

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Strong Passwords:**

   admin = "admin123"
   
   # ‚úÖ Good
   admin = "aD#9mK$2pL@8nQ!5"
   ```

2. **Regular Password Rotation:**
   - Change passwords every 90 days
   - Update in Streamlit Cloud secrets

3. **Limit User Access:**

   - Remove users who leave team

4. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Check for suspicious activity
   - Review access patterns

5. **Enable 2FA on GitHub:**
   - Protects your source code
   - Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Two-factor authentication

6. **Private Repository:**
   - Keep code private if handling sensitive data
   - Use GitHub private repository
