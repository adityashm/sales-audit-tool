## üîß How to Fix Data Issues

### Method 1: Fix in Excel (Recommended for Non-Technical Users)

1. **Open your original Excel file**
2. **Check the Data Health Check panel** in the app
3. **Look at the Excel row numbers** for missing values
4. **Go to those specific rows in Excel** and fill in the data
5. **Re-upload the fixed file**

**Example:**
```
If the app shows: "CUSTOMER DISTRICT: Missing in Excel rows: 2, 5, 8"

1. Open your Excel file
2. Go to row 2, find CUSTOMER DISTRICT column ‚Üí Fill it
3. Go to row 5, find CUSTOMER DISTRICT column ‚Üí Fill it  
4. Go to row 8, find CUSTOMER DISTRICT column ‚Üí Fill it
5. Save and re-upload
```

---

### Method 2: Fix with Python (For Technical Users)

#### Remove Missing Values:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your file
df = pd.read_excel('your_file.xlsx')

# Option 1: Remove rows with ANY missing values
df_clean = df.dropna()

# Option 2: Remove rows with missing values in SPECIFIC columns
df_clean = df.dropna(subset=['CUSTOMER DISTRICT', 'SOLD TO PARTY PAN NO.'])

# Option 3: Fill missing values
df['CUSTOMER DISTRICT'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)
df['SOLD TO PARTY PAN NO.'].fillna('N/A', inplace=True)

# Save cleaned file
df_clean.to_excel('cleaned_file.xlsx', index=False)
```

#### Remove Duplicates:
```python
# Remove duplicate rows (keep first occurrence)
df_clean = df.drop_duplicates()

# Remove duplicates based on specific columns
df_clean = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['MATERIAL CODE', 'CUSTOMER NAME', 'DATE'])

# Save
df_clean.to_excel('cleaned_file.xlsx', index=False)
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Prioritize High Impact Issues
Focus on columns with **‚ö†Ô∏è High** impact first:
- Issues affecting > 100 rows
- Issues in critical columns (Material Code, Price, Date)

### Tip 2: Use the Excel Report Offline
- Download the detailed Excel report
- Share with data team
- They can see exact rows to fix without opening the app

### Tip 3: Quick Validation
```python
# Check if specific rows have issues
df.loc[[1, 4, 7]]  # Check rows 2, 5, 8 in Excel (subtract 1 for Python index)
```

### Tip 4: Batch Fix Similar Issues
If many rows have the same issue:
```python
# Fill all missing CUSTOMER DISTRICT with 'Unknown'
df['CUSTOMER DISTRICT'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)
```

App shows: "Row 145" ‚Üí This is Excel row 145 in your file

Python users: Subtract 2 to get DataFrame index
Excel row 2 ‚Üí df.loc[0]
Excel row 145 ‚Üí df.loc[143]
```

## üìû Need Help?

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Why are row numbers different from my Excel file?**
A: Make sure you're looking at the same sheet. Row 2 = first data row after header.

**Q: Can I ignore missing values?**
A: Yes, but analysis will exclude those rows. Critical columns like Material Code and Price must have values.

**Q: How do I export just the rows with issues?**
A: Download the detailed Excel report - it lists all problematic rows.

**Q: What if I have thousands of missing values?**
A: The app shows first 20 rows in UI, but Excel report includes first 50 per column. Use Python for bulk fixes.
